# JS Table of Contents

This small tool lets you construct a table of contents dynamically from an HTML structure.

## Goals

With this project I aim to have a small and easy-to-use tool that constructs a table of contents based on an HTML file. I want to both be able to insert a table of contents in the DOM at runtime, and insert it permanently by making a brand new HTML file with the table of contents included.
