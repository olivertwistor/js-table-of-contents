# Tasks

In this document, we keep track of both a work breakdown structure and a network diagram.

## Work breakdown structure

| Task ID | Name                                                         | Priority | Depends upon |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| 11      | Construct a table of contents in memory                      | 1        |              |
| 12      | Output HTML dynamically after page load                      | 1        | 11           |
| 13      | Recreate the HTML with the table of contents permanently in the file | 2        | 11           |
| 14      | Let the user choose a max h-level to include                 | 3        | 11           |
| 15      | Let the user choose a min h-level to include                 | 3        | 11           |
| 16      | Let the user choose the containing element (for example a section) from which to construct the table of contents | 3        | 11           |
